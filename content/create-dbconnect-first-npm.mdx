title: "My First NPM Package: `create-dbconnect` — No More Repeating Boilerplate!"

summary: "Here’s a walkthrough of my first published NPM package, what problem it solves, how to use it, and how it works under the hood."

## 🚀 Introduction

Every time I created a new **Next.js project with MongoDB**, I found myself repeating the same task —  
writing a `dbConnect.ts` file with the same `mongoose.connect` logic, `.env` handling, and global caching.

It wasn’t just repetitive — it was **boring** and **error-prone** when done in a rush.

So I decided to turn that repetition into a reusable, zero-config CLI tool:

`npx create-dbconnect`

This was my **first ever published NPM package**, and I’m excited to share what it does, how to use it, and how it works under the hood.

## 💡 What Problem Does It Solve?

When you're working with **Next.js + TypeScript + MongoDB**, you often need the same exact `dbConnect.ts` file to:

- Connect to MongoDB using `mongoose`
- Cache the connection to prevent duplicate instances (especially during hot reload)
- Use `MONGODB_URI` from environment variables

Instead of:

- Manually creating `src/app/lib/`
- Writing `dbConnect.ts` from scratch
- Remembering to install `mongoose`

You can now just run:

`npx create-dbconnect`

And you're done ✅

This tool:

- **Creates the correct folder structure** if it doesn't exist  
- **Adds a fully typed, production-ready `dbConnect.ts` file**  
- **Installs `mongoose`** automatically if it's missing  

---

## ⚙️ How to Use It

Inside your Next.js project directory, run:

`npx create-dbconnect`

It will generate the following structure:

```text
src/
└── app/
    └── lib/
        └── dbConnect.ts
```

And it installs:

- [`mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) — if not already present

Now you can simply use the connection function like this:

```ts
import dbConnect from "@/app/lib/dbConnect";

await dbConnect();
````

No extra setup needed. It just works.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside the File?

The generated `dbConnect.ts` file contains:

* ✅ Type-safe caching with `global.mongoose`
* ✅ Auto fallback for `.env` variable `MONGODB_URI`
* ✅ Robust `try/catch` logic
* ✅ Recommended `bufferCommands` config

Here’s the full file:

```ts
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

declare global {
  var mongoose: {
    conn: typeof mongoose | null;
    promise: Promise<typeof mongoose> | null;
  } | undefined;
}

const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'your-mongo-uri-here';

let cached = global.mongoose;

if (!cached) {
  cached = global.mongoose = { conn: null, promise: null };
}

const connectToDatabase = async () => {
  if (cached.conn) return cached.conn;

  if (!cached.promise) {
    cached.promise = mongoose.connect(MONGODB_URI, {
      bufferCommands: true,
    }).then((mongoose) => mongoose);
  }

  cached.conn = await cached.promise;
  return cached.conn;
};

export default connectToDatabase;
```

## 🧠 How It Works Internally

Behind the scenes, the package does the following:

1. Locates or creates the `src/app/lib/` folder
2. Copies a pre-written `dbConnect.ts` template file into it
3. Checks if `mongoose` is already installed
4. If not, it runs:

`npm install mongoose`

All this is handled through a Node.js CLI using:

* `fs` — for file system operations
* `path` — for resolving directories
* `child_process` — to execute install commands

The goal was to keep it **simple**, **clean**, and **automatic**.

## 📦 Why This Package Matters to Me

This wasn’t just about boilerplate — it was also about:

* ✅ Learning how to build real CLI tools
* ✅ Publishing my **first NPM package**
* ✅ Saving time for myself and others in the dev community

It’s a small step, but a meaningful one in my developer journey.

## ✍️ A Blog on “How I Built This” is Coming Soon

This post was about **what the tool does** and **why it’s useful**.

But if you're curious about:

* How to build and structure an NPM package
* How to write Node.js-based CLI tools
* How to publish and version your package
* How to test it locally and link it globally

👉 I’ll be publishing a **follow-up blog soon** explaining how I built `create-dbconnect` from scratch.
