## üíª Your First HTML Page

During the session, we created a simple HTML structure to understand the basics:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage created in the Build Portfolio Workshop.</p>
    
    <h2>What I'm Learning:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How the web works</li>
        <li>HTML structure</li>
        <li>Web development basics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I'm excited to continue this journey!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Understanding the HTML Structure:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Tells the browser this is HTML5
- `<html>` - Root element of the page
- `<head>` - Contains meta information about the page
- `<title>` - What appears in the browser tab
- `<body>` - Contains the visible content
- `<h1>, <h2>` - Headings for structure
- `<p>` - Paragraphs of text
- `<ul>, <li>` - Unordered lists and list items
