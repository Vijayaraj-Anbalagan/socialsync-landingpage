<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="My portfolio website">
    <title>John Doe - Web Developer</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <h1>John Doe</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <section id="hero">
            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate web developer creating amazing digital experiences.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I love building websites that are both beautiful and functional.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="projects">
            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>Description of my first project.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
    </main>
    
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2025 John Doe. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### HTML Best Practices We Covered:

**Local Git Operations:**
1. **Initialize Repository**: `git init`
2. **Stage Changes**: `git add .` or `git add filename`
3. **Commit Changes**: `git commit -m "Descriptive message"`
4. **Check Status**: `git status`
5. **View History**: `git log`

**Remote Operations:**
1. **Connect to GitHub**: `git remote add origin <repository-url>`
2. **Push Changes**: `git push -u origin main`
3. **Pull Updates**: `git pull origin main`
4. **Clone Repository**: `git clone <repository-url>`

---

## üì¶ Understanding the Box Model

![CSS Box Model Visualization](/workshop/cssboxmodel.png)

### Box Model Components:
1. **Content**: The actual content of the element
2. **Padding**: Space between content and border
3. **Border**: The border around the element
4. **Margin**: Space outside the border

### Box Model in Practice:
```css
.example-box {
    width: 300px;          /* Content width */
    padding: 20px;         /* Inner spacing */
    border: 2px solid blue; /* Border */
    margin: 10px;          /* Outer spacing */
}
```

**Total Width Calculation:**
- Total Width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin-right
- Example: 300px + 20px + 20px + 2px + 2px + 10px + 10px = 364px
